      href="../44798-page-images/p003.jpg">003</a></span>was a Moorish maiden was sitting by a well,
  And what the maiden thought of, I cannot, cannot tell,
  When by there rode a valiant knight from the town of
           Oviedo&mdash;
  Alphonzo Guzman was he hight, the Count of Tololedo.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden, why sitt'st thou by the
           spring?
  Say, dost thou seek a lover, or any other thing?
  Why dost thou look upon me, with eyes so dark and wide,
  And wherefore doth the pitcher lie broken by thy side?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link004" id="link004"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p004.jpg">004</a></span>do not seek a lover, thou Christian knight so gay,
  Because an article like that hath never come my way;
  And why I gaze upon you, I cannot, cannot tell,
  Except that in your iron hose you look uncommon swell.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "My pitcher it is broken, and this the reason is,&mdash;
  A shepherd came behind me, and tried to snatch a kiss;
  I would not stand his nonsense, so ne'er a word I spoke,
  But scored him on the costard, and so the jug was broke.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "My uncle, the Alcaydè, he waits for me at home,
  And will not take his tumbler until Zorayda come:
  I cannot bring him water&mdash;the pitcher is in pieces&mdash;
  And so I'm sure to catch it, 'cos he wallops all his nieces."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden! wilt thou be ruled by me!
  So wipe thine eyes and rosy lips, and give me kisses three;
  And I'll give thee my helmet, thou kind and courteous lady,
  To carry home the water to thy uncle, the Alcaydè."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He lighted down from off his steed&mdash;he tied him to a
        tree&mdash;
  He bent him to the maiden, and he took his kisses three;
  "To wrong thee, sweet Zorayda, I swear would be a sin!"
  And he knelt him at the fountain, and he dipped his
        helmet in.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Up <span class="pagenum"><a name="link005" id="link005"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p005.jpg">005</a></span>rose the Moorish maiden&mdash;behind the knight she steals,
  And caught Alphonzo Guzman in a twinkling by the heels:
  She tipped him in, and held him down beneath the bub-
  bling water,&mdash;
  "Now, take thou that for venturing to kiss Al Hamet's
         daughter!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A Christian maid is weeping in the town of Oviedo;
  She waits the coming of her love, the Count of Tololedo.
  I pray you all in charity, that you will never tell,
  How he met the Moorish maiden beside the lonely well.

         knight,
  For the Saracenic warriors well they knew and feared his
         might;
  Long he lay and long he languished on his dripping bed
         of stone,
  Till the cankered iron fetters ate their way into his bone.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  On the twentieth day of August&mdash;'twas the feast of false
         Mahound&mdash;
  Came the Moorish population from the neighbouring cities
         round;
  There to hold their foul carousal, there to dance and there
         to sing,
  And to pay their yearly homage to Al-Widdicomb, the
        King!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  First they wheeled their supple coursers, wheeled them at
         their utmost speed,
  Then they galloped by in squadrons, tossing far the light
         jereed;
  Then around the circus racing, faster than the swallow
         flies,
  Did they spurn the yellow sawdust in the rapt spectators'
         eyes.

  Proudly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link008" id="link008"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p008.jpg">008</a></span>did the Moorish monarch every passing warrior
          greet,
  As he sate enthroned above them, with the lamps beneath
         his feet;
  "Tell me, thou black-bearded Cadi! are there any in the
         land,
  That against my janissaries dare one hour in combat stand?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then the bearded Cadi answered&mdash;"Be not wroth, my lord
         the King,
  If thy faithful slave shall venture to observe one little thing;
  Valiant, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link009" id="link009"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p009.jpg">009</a></span>doubtless, are thy warriors, and their beards are
          long and hairy,
  And a thunderbolt in battle is each bristly janissary:
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "But I cannot, O my sovereign, quite forget that fearful
         day,
  "When I saw the Christian army in its terrible array;
  When they charged across the footlights like a torrent
   down its bed,
  With the red cross floating o'er them, and Fernando at
        their head!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Don Fernando Gomersalez! matchless chieftain he in war,
  Mightier than Don Sticknejo, braver than the Cid Bivar!
  Not a cheek within Grenada, O my King, but wan and
        pale is,
  When they hear the dreaded name of Don Fernando
       Gomersalez!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Thou shalt see thy champion, Cadi! hither quick the
        captive bring!"
  Thus in wrath and deadly anger spoke Al-Widdicomb, the
        King:
  "Paler than a maiden's forehead is the Christian's hue, I
         ween,
  Since a year within the dungeons of Grenada he hath
        been!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then <span class="pagenum"><a name="link010" id="link010"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p010.jpg">010</a></span>they brought the Gomersalez, and they led the
         warrior in;
  Weak and wasted seemed his body, and his face was pale
        and thin;
  But the ancient fire was burning, unallayed, within his eye,
  And his step was proud and stately, and his look was stern
         and high.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Scarcely from tumultuous cheering could the galleried
        crowd refrain,
  For they knew Don Gomersalez and his prowess in the
        plain;
  But they feared the grizzly despot and his myrmidons in
         steel,
  So their sympathy descended in the fruitage of Seville.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Wherefore, monarch, hast thou brought me from the
        dungeon dark and drear,
  Where these limbs of mine have wasted in confinement
        for a year?
  Dost thou lead me forth to torture?&mdash;Rack and pincers
        I defy!
  Is it that thy base grotesquos may behold a hero die?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Hold thy peace, thou Christian caitiff, and attend to what
         I say!
  Thou art called the starkest rider of the Spanish cur's array:
  If <span class="pagenum"><a name="link011" id="link011"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p011.jpg">011</a></span>thy courage be undaunted, as they say it was of yore,
  Thou mayst yet achieve thy freedom,&mdash;yet regain thy
        native shore.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Courses three within this circus 'gainst my warriors shalt
          thou run,
  Ere yon weltering pasteboard ocean shall receive yon
        muslin sun;
  Victor&mdash;thou shalt have thy freedom; but if stretched
         upon the plain,
  To thy dark and dreary dungeon they shall hale thee back
         again."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Give me but the armour, monarch, I have worn in many
         a field,
  Give me but my trusty helmet, give me but my dinted
        shield;
  And my old steed, Bavieca, swiftest courser in the ring,
  And I rather should imagine that I'll do the business, King!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then they carried down the armour from the garret where
         it lay,
  O! but it was red and rusty, and the plumes were shorn
         away:
  And they led out Bavieca from a foul and filthy van,
  For the conqueror had sold him to a Moorish dogs'-meat
         man.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link012" id="link012"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p012.jpg">012</a></span>the steed beheld his master, then he whinnied loud
          and free,
  And, in token of subjection, knelt upon each broken knee;
  And a tear of walnut largeness to the warrior's eyelids
         rose,
  As he fondly picked a bean-straw from his coughing
        courser's nose.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Many a time, O Bavieca, hast thou borne me through
        the fray!
  Bear me but again as deftly through the listed ring this
         day;
  Or if thou art worn and feeble, as may well have come to
         pass,
  Time it is, my trusty charger, both of us were sent to grass!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then he seized his lance, and vaulting in the saddle sate
         upright;
  Marble seemed the noble courser, iron seemed the mailèd
         knight;
  And a cry of admiration burst from every Moorish lady.
  "Five to four on Don Fernando!" cried the sable-bearded
         Cadi.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Warriors three from Alcantara burst into the listed space,
  Warriors three, all bred in battle, of the proud Alhambra
         race:
  Trumpets <span class="pagenum"><a name="link013" id="link013"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p013.jpg">013</a></span>sounded, coursers bounded, and the foremost
         straight went down,
  Tumbling, like a sack of turnips, just before the jeering
         Clown.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In the second chieftain galloped, and he bowed him to the
         King,
  And his saddle-girths were tightened by the Master of the
         Ring;
  Through three blazing hoops he bounded ere the desperate
         fight began&mdash;
  Don Fernando! bear thee bravely!&mdash;'tis the Moor Abdor-
         rhoman!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Like a double streak of lightning, clashing in the sulphurous
          sky,
  Met the pair of hostile heroes, and they made the sawdust
  And the Moslem spear so stiffly smote on Don Fernando's
         mail,
  That he reeled, as if in liquor, back to Bavieca's tail:
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But he caught the mace beside him, and he griped it hard
         and fast,
  And he swung it starkly upwards as the foeman bounded
         past;
  And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link014" id="link014"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p014.jpg">014</a></span>the deadly stroke descended through, the skull and
         through the brain,
  As ye may have seen a poker cleave a cocoa-nut in twain.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sore astonished was the monarch, and the Moorish warriors
         all,
  Save the third bold chief, who tarried and beheld his
        brethren fall;
  And the Clown, in haste arising from the footstool where
         he sat,
  Notified the first appearance of the famous Acrobat;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Never on a single charger rides that stout and stalwart
         Moor,&mdash;
  Five beneath his stride so stately bear him o'er the
        trembling floor;
  Five Arabians, black as midnight&mdash;on their necks the rein
         he throws,
  And the outer and the inner feel the pressure of his toes.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Never wore that chieftain armour; in a knot himself he
        ties,
  With his grizzly head appearing in the centre of his
        thighs,
  Till the petrified spectator asks, in paralysed alarm,
  Where may be the warrior's body,&mdash;which is leg, and
        which is arm?

         and furious vault,
  High in air the Moorish champion cut a wondrous somer-
        sault;
  O'er the head of Don Fernando like a tennis-ball he sprung,
  Caught him tightly by the girdle, and behind the crupper
         hung.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then his dagger Don Fernando plucked from out its
        jewelled sheath,
  And he struck the Moor so fiercely, as he grappled him
        beneath,
  That <span class="pagenum"><a name="link016" id="link016"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p016.jpg">016</a></span>the good Damascus weapon sank within the folds
         of fat,
  And as dead as Julius Cæsar dropped the Gordian
        Acrobat.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Meanwhile fast the sun was sinking&mdash;it had sunk beneath
         the sea,
  Ere Fernando Gomersalez smote the latter of the three;
  And Al-Widdicomb, the monarch, pointed, with a bitter
         smile,
  To the deeply-darkening canvass;&mdash;blacker grew it all the
         while.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Thou hast slain my warriors, Spaniard! but thou hast
         not kept thy time;
  Only two had sunk before thee ere I heard the curfew
        chime;
  Back thou goest to thy dungeon, and thou mayst be
        wondrous glad
  That thy head is on thy shoulders for thy work to-day,
         my lad!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Therefore all thy boasted valour, Christian dog, of no
         avail is!"
  Dark as midnight grew the brow of Don Fernando Gomer-
         salez;&mdash;
  Stiffly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link017" id="link017"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p017.jpg">017</a></span>sate he in his saddle, grimly looked around the
         ring,
  Laid his lance within the rest, and shook his gauntlet at
         the King.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "O, thou foul and faithless traitor! wouldst thou play me
         false again?
  Welcome death and welcome torture, rather than the
        captive's chain!
  But I give thee warning, caitiff! Look thou sharply to
        thine eye&mdash;
  Unavenged, at least in harness, Gomersalez shall not
        die!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Thus he spoke, and Bavieca like an arrow forward flew,
  Right and left the Moorish squadron wheeled to let the
        hero through;
  Brightly gleamed the lance of vengeance&mdash;fiercely sped
        the fatal thrust&mdash;
  From his throne the Moorish monarch tumbled lifeless in
        the dust.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

  Thrilled the Master of the Ring,
  When he first beheld the lady
  Through the stabled portal spring!
  Midway in his wild grimacing
  Stopped the piebald-visaged Clown
  And the thunders of the audience
  Nearly brought the gallery down.

  Saw ye ever such a maid,
  With the feathers swaling o'er her,
  And her spangled rich brocade?
  In her fairy hand a horsewhip,
  On her foot a buskin small,
  So she stepped, the stately damsel,
  Through the scarlet grooms and all.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And she beckoned for her courser,
  And they brought a milk-white mare;
  Proud, I ween, was that Arabian
  Such a gentle freight to bear:
  And the Master moved to greet her,
  With a proud and stately walk;
  And, in reverential homage,
  Rubbed her soles with virgin chalk.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Round she flew, as Flora flying
  Spans the circle of the year;
  And the youth of London, sighing,
  Half forgot the ginger-beer&mdash;
  Quite forgot the maids beside them;
  As they surely well might do,
  When she raised two Roman candles,
  Shooting fireballs red and blue!
  Swifter <span class="pagenum"><a name="link022" id="link022"></a><a

  Lighter than the lark in flight,
  On the left foot now she bounded,
  Now she stood upon the right.
  Like a beautiful Bacchante,
  Here she soars, and there she kneels,
  While amid her floating tresses
  Flash two whirling Catherine wheels!
  Hark! the blare of yonder trumpet!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  See, the gates are opened wide!
  Room, there, room for Gomersalez,&mdash;
  Gomersalez in his pride!
  Rose the shouts of exultation,
  Rose the cat's triumphant call,

  Over Master, Clown, and all!
  Donna Inez Woolfordinez!

  Why those blushes on thy cheek?
  Doth thy trembling bosom tell thee,

  And the other on his tail!
  Onward, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link023" id="link023"></a><a

  He is faint, and fails, for now
  By the feet he hangs suspended
  From his glistening saddle-bow.
  Down are gone both cap and feather,
  Lance and gonfalon are down!
  Trunks, and cloak, and vest of velvet,
  He has flung them to the Clown,
  Faint and failing! Up he vaulteth,
  Fresh as when he first began;
  All in coat of bright vermilion,
  'Quipped as Shaw, the Lifeguardsman;
  Eight and left his whizzing broadsword,
  Like a sturdy flail, he throws;
  Cutting out a path unto thee
  Through imaginary foes.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Woolfordinez! speed thee onward!
  He is hard upon thy track,&mdash;
  Paralysed is Widdicombez,
  Nor his whip can longer crack;

  Onward!&mdash;see, he bares his bosom,
  Tears away his scarlet vest;
  Leaps <span class="pagenum"><a name="link024" id="link024"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p024.jpg">024</a></span>from out his nether garments,
  And his leathern stock unties&mdash;
  As the flower of London's dustmen,
  Now in swift pursuit he flies.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Nimbly now he cuts and shuffles,
  O'er the buckle, heel and toe!
  Flaps his hands in his tail-pockets,
  Winks to all the throng below!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Onward, onward rush the coursers;
  Woolfordinez, peerless girl,
  O'er the garters lightly bounding
  From her steed with airy whirl!
  Gomersalez, wild with passion,
  Danger&mdash;all but her&mdash;forgets;
  Wheresoe'er she flies, pursues her,
  Casting clouds of somersets!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Onward, onward rush the coursers;
  Bright is Gomersalez' eye;
  Saints protect thee, Woolfordinez,
  For his triumph sure is nigh:
  Now his courser's flanks he lashes,
  O'er his shoulder flings the rein,
  And his feet aloft he tosses,
  Holding stoutly by the mane!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link025" id="link025"></a><a

  Doffs his jacket, doffs his smalls,
  And in graceful folds around him
  A bespangled tunic falls.
  Pinions from his heels are bursting,
  His bright locks have pinions o'er them;
  And the public see with rapture
  Maia's nimble son before them.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Speed thee, speed thee, Woolfordinez!
  For a panting god pursues;
  And the chalk is very nearly
  Rubbed from thy White satin shoes;
  Every bosom throbs with terror,
  You might hear a pin to drop;
  All is hushed, save where a starting
  Cork gives out a casual pop.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  One smart lash across his courser,
  One tremendous bound and stride,
  And our noble Cid was standing
  By his Woolfordinez' side!
  With a god's embrace he clasped her,
  Raised her in his manly arms;
  And the stables' closing barriers
  Hid his valour, and her charms!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Straightway leaped the valiant Slingsby
  Into armour of Seville,
  With a strong Arkansas toothpick
  Screwed in every joint of steel.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Come thou with me, Cullen Bryant,
  Come with me, as squire, I pray;
  Be the Homer of the battle
  Which I go to wage to-day."

  So <span class="pagenum"><a name="link031" id="link031"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p031.jpg">031</a></span>they went along careering
  With a loud and martial tramp,
  Till they neared the Snapping Turtle
  In the dreary Swindle Swamp.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But when Slingsby saw the water,
  Somewhat pale, I ween, was he.
  "If I come not back, dear Bryant,
  Tell the tale to Melanie!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Tell her that I died devoted,
  Victim to a noble task!
  Han't you got a drop of brandy
  In the bottom of your flask?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  As he spoke, an alligator
  Swam across the sullen creek;
  And the two Columbians started,
  When they heard the monster shriek;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  For a snout of huge dimensions
  Rose above the waters high,
  And took down the alligator,
  As a trout takes down a fly.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "'Tarnal death! the Snapping Turtle!"
  Thus the squire in terror cried;
  But the noble Slingsby straightway
  Drew the toothpick from his side.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Fare <span class="pagenum"><a name="link032" id="link032"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p032.jpg">032</a></span>thee well!" he cried, and dashing
  Through the waters, strongly swam:
  Meanwhile, Cullen Bryant, watching,
  Breathed a prayer and sucked a dram.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sudden from the slimy bottom
  Was the snout again upreared,
  With a snap as loud as thunder,&mdash;
  And the Slingsby disappeared.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Like a mighty steam-ship foundering,
  Down the monstrous vision sank;
  And the ripple, slowly rolling,
  Plashed and played upon the bank.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Still and stiller grew the water,
  Hushed the canes within the brake;
  There was but a kind of coughing
  At the bottom of the lake.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Bryant wept as loud and deeply
  As a father for a son&mdash;
  "He's a finished 'coon, is Slingsby,
  And the brandy's nearly done!"

      THE LAY OF MR COLT.

      href="../44798-page-images/p038.jpg">038</a></span>story of Mr Colt, of
      which our Lay contains merely the sequel, is this: A New York printer, of
      the name of Adams, had the effrontery to call upon him one day for payment
      of an account, which the independent Colt settled by cutting his
      creditor's head to fragments with an axe. He then packed his body in a
      box, sprinkling it with salt, and despatched it to a packet bound for New
      Orleans. Suspicions having been excited, he was seized and tried before
      Judge Kent. The trial is, perhaps, the most disgraceful upon the records
      of any country. The ruffian's mistress was produced in court, and
      examined, in disgusting detail, as to her connection with Colt, and his
      movements during the days and nights succeeding the murder. The head of
      the murdered man was bandied to and fro in the court, handed up to the
      jury, and commented on by witnesses and counsel; and to crown the horrors
      of the whole proceeding, the wretch's own counsel, a Mr Emmet, commencing
      the defence with a cool admission that his client took the life of Adams,
      and following it up by a de-tail of the whole circumstances of this most
      brutal-murder in the first person, as though he himself had been the
      murderer, ended by telling the jury, that his client was "<i>entitled to
      the sympathy</i> of a jury of his country," as "a young man just entering
      into life, <i>whose prospects, probably, have been permanently blasted</i>."
      Colt was found guilty; but a variety of exceptions were taken to the
      charge by the judge, and after a long series of appeals, which <i>occupied
      more than a year from the date of conviction</i>, the sentence of death
      was ratified by Governor Seward. The rest of Colt's story is told in our
      ballad.]

      America, intelligence was received in this country of an affray in
      Congress, very nearly the counterpart of that which the Author has here
      imagined in jest. It was very clear, to any one who observed the state of
      public manners in America, that such occurrences <i>must</i> happen,
      sooner or later. The Americans apparently felt the force of the satire, as
      the poem was widely reprinted throughout the States. It subsequently
      returned to this country, embodied in an American work on American
      manners, where it characteristically appeared as the writer's <i>own</i>
      production; and it afterwards went the round of British newspapers, as an
      amusing satire, by an American, of his countrymen's foibles!]

  The Congress met, the day was wet, Van Buren took the

  On either side, the statesman pride of far Kentuck was

  Upon that day, near gifted Clay, a youthful member sat,
  And like a free American upon the floor he spat;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Avoid that knife. In frequent strife its blade, so long

  Then up he rose, and cleared his nose, and looked toward

  His heart beat high, with eldritch cry upon the floor he

  He nerved his might for one last spring, and as he sank
         and died,
  Reft of an eye, his enemy fell groaning by his side.

  How nobly Dollar gouged his man&mdash;how gallantly he fell.

         Fixings, you
  Pay Mister Nehemiali Dodge them dollars as you're due.
  You are a bloody cheat,&mdash;you are. But spite of all your
         tricks, it
  Is not in you Judge Lynch to do. No! nohow you can
         fix it!"
</pre>

      href="../44798-page-images/p051.jpg">051</a></span>spake Judge Lynch, as there he sat in Alabama's
         forum,
  Around he gazed, with legs upraised upon the bench before
         him;
  And, as he gave this sentence stern to him who stood
         beneath,
  Still with his gleaming bowie-knife he slowly picked his
         teeth.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  It was high noon, the month was June, and sultry was the
         air,
  A cool gin-sling stood by his hand, his coat hung o'er his
         chair;
  All naked were his manly arms, and shaded by his hat,
  Like an old senator of Rome that simple Archon sat.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "A bloody cheat?&mdash;Oh, legs and feet!" in wrath young
         Silas cried;
  And springing high into the air, he jerked his quid
         aside.
  "No man shall put my dander up, or with my feelings
         trifle,
  As long as Silas Fixings wears a bowie-knife and rifle."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "If your shoes pinch," replied Judge Lynch, "you'll very,
         soon have ease;
  I'll give you satisfaction, squire, in any way you please;
  What are your weapons?&mdash;knife or gun?&mdash;at both I'm
         pretty spry!"
  "Oh! 'tarnal death, you're spry, you are?" quoth Silas;
         "so am I!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Hard by the town a forest stands, dark with the shades
         of time,
  And they have sought that forest dark at morning's early
         prime;
  Lynch, backed by Nehemiah Dodge, and Silas with a
        friend,
  And half the town in glee came down to see that contest's
         end.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They led their men two miles apart, they measured out
         the ground;
  A belt of that, vast wood it was, they notched the trees
         around;
  Into the tangled brake they turned them off, and neither
         knew
  Where he should seek his wagered foe, how get him into
         view.

         ceived a plan,
  An artful dodge whereby to take at unawares his man;
  He hung his hat upon a bush, and hid himself hard by;
  Young Silas thought he had him fast, and at the hat let
         fly.
  It fell; up sprang young Silas,&mdash;he hurled his gun
        away;
  Lynch fixed him with his rifle, from the ambush where he
         lay.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The bullet pierced his manly breast&mdash;yet, valiant to the

         Kean:
  Brave Lynch received him with a bang that stretched him
         on the ground,
  Then sat himself serenely down till all the crowd drew

  That noble judge, whose daring hand enforced his own

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      THE AMERICAN'S APOSTROPHE TO BOZ
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Rapidly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link056" id="link056"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p056.jpg">056</a></span>as oblivion does its
      work nowadays, the burst of amiable indignation with which enlightened
      America received the issue of Boz's <i>Notes</i> can scarcely yet be
      forgotten. Not content with waging a universal rivalry in the piracy of
      the work, Columbia showered upon its author the riches of its own choice
      vocabulary of abuse; while some of her more fiery spirits threw out
      playful hints as to the propriety of gouging the "stranger," and
      furnishing him with a permanent suit of tar and feathers, in the very
      improbable event of his paying them a second visit. The perusal of these
      animated expressions of free opinion suggested the following lines, which
      those who remember Boz's book, and the festivities with which he was all
      but hunted to death, will at once understand. We hope we have done justice
      to the bitterness and "immortal hate" of these thin-skinned sons of
      freedom. When will Americans cease to justify the ridicule of Europe, by
      bearing rebuke, or even misrepresentation, calmly as a great nation
      should?]

  Sneak across the wide Atlantic, worthless London's puling

  Better that its waves should bear thee, than the land thou

  Sickening as the fetid nigger bears the greens and bacon by;
  Better, when the midnight horrors haunt the strained and
         creaking ship,
  Thou shouldst yell in vain for brandy with a fever-sodden
         lip;

<pre xml:space="preserve">

  Smirking like a Tracy Tupman with a Mantalini mien,
  With a rivulet of satin falling o'er thy puny chest,
  Worse than even P. Willis for an evening party drest!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We received thee warmly&mdash;kindly&mdash;though we knew thou
        wert a quiz,
  Partly for thyself it may be, chiefly for the sake of Phiz!
  Much we bore, and much we suffered, listening to remorse-
         less spells
  Of that Smike's unceasing drivellings, and these everlast-
         ing Nells.
  When you talked of babes and sunshine, fields, and all
        that sort of thing,
  Each Columbian inly chuckled, as he slowly sucked his
        sling;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And though all our sleeves were bursting, from the many
         hundreds near
  Not one single scornful titter rose on thy complacent ear.
  Then to show thee to the ladies, with our usual want of sense
  We engaged the place in Park Street at a ruinous expense;
  Even our own three-volumed Cooper waived his old pre-
        scriptive right,
  And deluded Dickens figured first on that eventful night.

   Saw thee desperately plunging through, the perils of La
          Poule:
   And their muttered exclamation drowned the tenor of the
          tune,&mdash;
   "Don't he beat all natur hollow? Don't He foot it like a
           'coon?"
   Did we spare our brandy-cocktails, stint thee of our whisky-
           grogs?
   Half the juleps that we gave thee would have floored a
          Newman Noggs;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   And thou took'st them in so kindly, little was there then
          to blame,
   To thy parched and panting palate sweet as mother's milk
          they came.
   Did the hams of old Virginny find no favour in thine
          eyes?
   Came no soft compunction o'er thee at the thought of
          pumpkin pies?
   Could not all our chicken fixings into silence fix thy scorn?
   Did not all our cakes rebuke thee, Johnny, waffle, dander,
           corn?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Could not all our care and coddling teach, thee how to

  You, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link059" id="link059"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p059.jpg">059</a></span>forsooth, must come crusading, boring us with broad-
          est hints
  Of your own peculiar losses by American reprints.
  Such an impudent remonstrance never in our face was flung;
  Lever stands it, so does Ainsworth; <i>you</i>, I guess, may hold
          your tongue.

  Downpour throats you'd cram your projects, thick and hard
         as pickled salmon,
  That, I s'pose, you call free trading,&mdash;I pronounce it utter
          gammon.
  No, my lad, a 'cuter vision than your own might soon
        have seen
  That a true Columbian ogle carries little that is green;
  That we never will surrender useful privateering rights,
  Stoutly won at glorious Bunker's Hill, and other famous
         fights;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  That we keep our native dollars for our native scribbling
         gents,
  And on British manufacture only waste our straggling cents;
  Quite enough we pay, I reckon, when we stump of these a few
  For the voyages and travels of a freshman such as you.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I have been at Niagara, I have stood beneath the Falls,
  I have marked the water twisting over its rampagious walls;
  But "a holy calm sensation," one, in fact, of perfect peace,
  Was as much my first idea as the thought of Christmas
        geese.
  As for <span class="pagenum"><a name="link060" id="link060"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p060.jpg">060</a></span>"old familiar faces," looking through the misty air,
  Surely you were strongly liquored when you saw your
  Chuckster there.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  One familiar face, however, you will very likely see,
  If you'll only treat the natives to a call in Tennessee,
  Of a certain individual, true Columbian every inch,
  In a high judicial station, called by 'mancipators, Lynch.
  Half an hour of conversation with his worship in a wood,
  Would, I strongly notion, do you an infernal deal of good.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then you'd understand more clearly than you ever did
         before,
  Why an independent patriot freely spits upon the floor,
  Why he gouges when he pleases, why he whittles at the
         chairs,
  Why for swift and deadly combat still the bowie-knife he
         bears,&mdash;
  Why he sneers at the old country with republican disdain,
  And, unheedful of the negro's cry, still tighter draws his
        chain.

      THE STUDENT OF JENA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Once&mdash;'twas <span class="pagenum"><a name="link063" id="link063"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p063.jpg">063</a></span>when I lived at Jena&mdash;
  At a Wirthshous' door I sat;
  And in pensive contemplation
  Ate the sausage thick and fat'
  Ate the kraut that never sourer
  Tasted to my lips than here;
  Smoked my pipe of strong canaster,
  Sipped my fifteenth jug of beer;
  Gazed upon the glancing river,
  Gazed upon the tranquil pool,
  Whence <span class="pagenum"><a name="link064" id="link064"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p064.jpg">064</a></span>the silver-voiced Undine,
  When the nights were calm and cool,
  As the Baron Fouqué tells us,
  Rose from out her shelly grot,
  Casting glamour o'er the waters,
  Witching that enchanted spot.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  From the shadow which the coppice
  Flings across the rippling stream,
  Did I hear a sound of music&mdash;
  Was it thought or was it dream?
  There, beside a pile of linen,
  Stretched along the daisied sward,
  Stood a young and blooming maiden&mdash;
  'Twas her thrush-like song I heard.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Evermore within the eddy
  Did she plunge the white chemise;
  And her robes were losely gathered
  Rather far above her knees;
  Then my breath at once forsook me,
  For too surely did I deem
  That I saw the fair Undine
  Standing in the glancing stream&mdash;
  And I felt the charm of knighthood;
  And from that remembered day,
  Every evening to the Wirthshaus
  Took I my enchanted way.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Shortly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link065" id="link065"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p065.jpg">065</a></span>to relate my story,
  Many a week of summer long
  Came I there, when beer-o'ertaken,
  With my lute and with my song;
  Sang in mellow-toned soprano
  All my love and all my woe,
  Till the river-maiden answered,
  Lilting in the stream below:&mdash;
  "Fair Undine! sweet Undine!
  Dost thou love as I love thee?"
  "Love is free as running water,"
  Was the answer made to me.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Thus, in interchange seraphic,
  Did I woo my phantom fay,
  Till the nights grew long and chilly,
  Short and shorter grew the day;
  Till at last&mdash;'twas dark and gloomy,
  Dull and starless was the sky,
  And my steps were all unsteady,
  For a little flushed was I,&mdash;
  To the well-accustomed signal
  No response the maiden gave;
  But I heard the waters washing,
  And the moaning of the wave.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Vanished <span class="pagenum"><a name="link066" id="link066"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p066.jpg">066</a></span>was my own Undine,
  All her linen, too, was gone;
  And I walked about lamenting
  On the river bank alone.
  Idiot that I was, for never
  Had I asked the maiden's name.
  Was it Lieschen&mdash;was it Gretchen?
  Had she tin, or whence she came?
  So I took my trusty meerschaum,
  And I took my lute likewise;
  Wandered forth in minstrel fashion,
  Underneath the louring skies;
  Sang before each comely Wirthshaus,
  Sang beside each purling stream,
  That same ditty which I chanted
  When Undine was my theme,
  Singing, as I sang at Jena,
  When the shifts were hung to dry,
  "Fair Undine! young Undine!
  Dost thou love as well as I?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But, alas! in field or village,
  Or beside the pebbly shore,
  Did I see those glancing ankles,
  And the white robe never more;
  And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link067" id="link067"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p067.jpg">067</a></span>no answer came to greet me,
  No sweet voice to mine replied;
  But I heard the waters rippling,
  And the moaning of the tide.

  In our cellars there is plenty;

  But 'tis really past endurance,
      When you squeeze my hand!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And he heard her as if dreaming,
      Heard her half in awe;
  And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link071" id="link071"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p071.jpg">071</a></span>the meerschaum's smoke came streaming
      From his open jaw:
  And his pulse heat somewhat quicker
      Than it did before,
  And he finished off his liquor,
      Staggered through the door;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Bolted off direct to Munich,
      And within the year
  Underneath his German tunic
      Stowed whole butts of beer.
  And he drank like fifty fishes,
      Drank till all was blue;
  For he felt extremely vicious&mdash;
      Somewhat thirsty too.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But at length this dire deboshing
      Drew towards an end;
  Few of all his silver groschen
      Had he left to spend.
  And he knew it was not prudent
      Longer to remain;
  So, with weary feet, the student
      Wended home again.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  At the tavern's well-known portal
      Knocks he as before,
  And a <span class="pagenum"><a name="link072" id="link072"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p072.jpg">072</a></span>waiter, rather mortal,
      Hiccups through the door&mdash;
  "Master's sleeping in the kitchen
      You'll alarm the house;
  Yesterday the Jungfrau Fritchen
      Married baker Kraus!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Like a fiery comet bristling,
      Rose the young man's hair,
  And, poor soul! he fell a-whistling
      Out of sheer despair.
  Down the gloomy street in silence,
      Savage-calm he goes;
  But he did no deed of vi'lence&mdash;
      Only blew his nose.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then he hired an airy garret
      Near her dwelling-place;
  Grew a beard of fiercest carrot,
      Never washed his face;
  Sate all day beside the casement,
      Sate a dreary man;
  Found in smoking such an easement
      As the wretched can;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Stared for hours and hours together.
      Stared yet more and more;
  Till <span class="pagenum"><a name="link073" id="link073"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p073.jpg">073</a></span>in fine and sunny weather.
      At the baker's door,
  Stood, in apron white and mealy,
      That beloved dame,
  Counting out the loaves so freely,
      Selling of the same.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then like a volcano puffing,
      Smoked he out his pipe;
  Sighed and supped on ducks and stuffing,
      Ham and kraut and tripe;
  Went to bed, and, in the morning,
      Waited as before,
  Still his eyes in anguish turning
      To the baker's door;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Till, with apron white and mealy,
      Came the lovely dame,
  Counting out the loaves so freely,
      Selling of the same.
  So one day&mdash;the fact's amazing!&mdash;
      On his post he died!
  And they found the body gazing
      At the baker's bride.

  For his drinking, to the street.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But the moonlight, pale and broken,
  Pained at soul the Baron's son;
  For he knew, by that soft token,
  That the larking had begun;&mdash;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  That the stout and valiant Marquis
  Then was leading forth his swells,
  Milling some policeman's carcass,
  Or purloining private bells.
</pre>

  So he sat in grief and sorrow,
  Rather drunk than otherwise,
  Till the golden gush of morrow
  Dawned once more upon his eyes:

<pre xml:space="preserve">

  Lightly tapping at the door,
  Brought his draught of soda-water,
  Brandy-bottomed as before.

  Think you, made a deal of brass?"
  And she answered&mdash;"Sir, I rather

  Uwins then, his whiskers scratching,
  Leered upon the maiden's face,

  Said the daughter of the Jew:
  "Dearest, how those eyes delight me!
  Let me love thee, darling, do!"
</pre>

  "Vat is dish?" the Bailiff muttered,
  Rushing in with fury wild;
  "Ish your muffins so veil buttered,

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Honourable my intentions,
  Good Abednego, I swear!
  And I have some small pretensions,
  For I am a Baron's heir.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  If you'll only clear my credit,
  And advance a <i>thou</i> * or so,
  She's a peeress&mdash;I have said it:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The fashionable abbreviation for a thousand pounds.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Datsh a very different matter,"

<pre xml:space="preserve">

  Rose before his shuddering view,
  For he knew that circumcision
  Was expected from a Jew.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  At a meeting of the Rabbis,
  Held about the Whitsuntide,
  Was this thorough-paced Barabbas
  Wedded to his Hebrew bride:
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  All his previous debts compounded,
  From the sponging-house he came,
  And his father's feelings wounded
  With reflections on the same.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But the sire his son accosted&mdash;
  "Split my wig! if any more

  That the orders of the master
  Would be punctually obeyed:
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sought his club, and then the sentence
  Of expulsion first he saw;
  No one dared to own acquaintance
  With a Bailiff's son-in-law.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Uselessly, down Bond Street strutting,
  Did he greet his friends of yore:
  Such a universal cutting
  Never man received before:
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Till at last his pride revolted&mdash;
  Pale, and lean, and stern he grew;
  And his wife Rebecca bolted
  With a missionary Jew.

  Old the legend is, and true&mdash;
  How a knyghte of fame and glory
  All aside his armour threw;
  Spouted spear and pawned habergeon,
  Pledged his sword and surcoat gay,
  Sate down cross-legged on the shop-board,
  Sate and stitched the livelong day?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Taylzeour! <span class="pagenum"><a name="link092" id="link092"></a><a

  Does my breeches-pocket hold:
  I to pay am really willing,
  If I only had the gold.
  Farmers none can I encounter,
  Graziers there are none to kill;
  Therefore, prithee, gentle taylzeour,
  Bother not about thy bill."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Good Sir Knyghte, just once too often
  Have you tried that slippery trick;
  Hearts like mine you cannot soften,
  Vainly do you ask for tick.
  Christmas and its bills are coming,
  Soon will they be showering in;
  Therefore, once for all, my rum un,
  I expect you'll post the tin.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Mark, Sir Knyghte, that gloomy bayliffe
  In the palmer's amice brown;
  He shall lead you unto jail, if
  Instantly you stump not down."
  Deeply swore the young crusader,
  But the taylzeour would not hear;
  And the gloomy, bearded bayliffe
  Evermore kept sneaking near.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Neither groat nor maravedi
  Have I got my soul to bless;
  And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link093" id="link093"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p093.jpg">093</a></span>I'd feel extremely seedy,
  Languishing in vile duresse.
  Therefore listen, ruthless taylzeour,
  Take my steed and armour free,
  Pawn them at thy Hebrew uncle's,
  And I'll work the rest for thee."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Lightly leaped he on the shop-board,
  Lightly crooked his manly limb,
  Lightly drove the glancing needle
  Through the growing doublet's rim.
  Gaberdines in countless number
  Did the taylzeour knyghte repair,
  And entirely on cucumber
  And on cabbage lived he there.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Once his weary task beguiling
  With a low and plaintive song,
  That good knyghte o'er miles of broadcloth
  Drove the hissing goose along;
  From her lofty latticed window
  Looked the taylzeour's daughter down,
  And she instantly discovered
  That her heart was not her own.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Canst thou love me, gentle stranger?"
  Picking at a pink she stood&mdash;
  And the knyghte at once admitted
  That he rather thought he could.
  "He <span class="pagenum"><a name="link094" id="link094"></a><a

  "For a single pair of&mdash;<i>small-clothes</i>,
  I would roam the world with thee!"

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then she flung him down the tickets&mdash;
  Well the knyghte their import knew&mdash;
  "Take this gold, and win thy armour

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Well and bravely did they bear them,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  It was the Lord of Castlereagh, he sat within his room,
  His arms were crossed upon his breast, his face was
        marked with gloom;
  They said that St Helena's Isle had rendered up its
        charge,
  That France was bristling high in arms&mdash;the Emperor at
        large.

         death the street,
  It might be that the watchman slept that night upon his
         beat,
  When lo! a heavy foot was heard to creak upon the
        stair,
  The door revolved upon its hinge&mdash;Great Heaven!&mdash;What
         enters there?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A little man, of stately mien, with slow and solemn
        stride;
  His hands are crossed upon his back, his coat is opened

  And on his vest of green he wears an eagle and a
        star,&mdash;
  Saint George! protect us! 'tis The Man&mdash;the thunder-
         bolt of war!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Is that the famous hat that waved along Marengo's
        ridge?
  Are these the spurs of Austerlitz&mdash;the boots of Lodi's

          and dry,
  As in his brain he felt the glare of that tremendous eye;
  What wonder if he shrunk in fear, for who could meet the
         glance
  Of him who reared, 'mid Russian snows, the gonfalon of
         France?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  From the side-pocket of his vest a pinch the despot
        took,
  Yet not a whit did he relax the sternness of his look:
  "Thou thoughtst the lion was afar, but he hath burst the

  I laugh to scorn thy bolts and bars&mdash;I burst them, and
         am free.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Let me go. Nay, Chuckster, blow me, 'pon my soul, this

  Like my faithless cousin Amy when she drove me to

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, my cousin, spider-hearted! Oh, my Amy! No, con-

  I must wear the mournful willow,&mdash;all around my hat

  Falser than the bank of fancy, frailer than a shilling glove,
  Puppet to a father's anger, minion to a nabob's love!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Is it well to wish thee happy? Having known me, could

  Brandy at the Cider Cellars, kidneys smoking-hot at

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Or in the Adelphi sitting, half in rapture, half in tears,
  Saw the glorious melodrama conjure up the shades of

  Saw Jack Sheppard, noble stripling, act his wondrous feats

  Snapping Newgate's bars of iron, like an infant's daisy

  Decked <span class="pagenum"><a name="link112" id="link112"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p112.jpg">112</a></span>with shoes of blackest polish,
  And with shirt as white as snow,
  After matutinal breakfast
  To my daily desk I go;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  First a fond salute bestowing
  On my Mary's ruby lips,
  Which, perchance, may be rewarded
  With a pair of playful nips.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  All day long across the ledger
  Still my patient pen I drive,
  Thinking what a feast awaits me
  In my happy home at five;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In my small one-storeyed Eden,
  Where my wife awaits my coming,
  And our solitary handmaid
  Mutton-chops with care is crumbing.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link113" id="link113"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p113.jpg">113</a></span>the clock proclaims my freedom,
  Then my hat I seize and vanish;
  Every trouble from my bosom,
  Every anxious care I banish.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Swiftly brushing o'er the pavement,
  At a furious pace I go,
  Till I reach my darling dwelling
  In the wilds of Pimlico.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Mary, wife, where art thou, dearest?"
  Thus I cry, while yet afar;
  Ah! what scent invades my nostrils?&mdash;
  'Tis the smoke of a cigar!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Instantly into the parlour
  Like a maniac I haste,
  And I find a young Life-Guardsman,
  With his arm round Mary's waist.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And his other hand is playing
  Most familiarly with hers;
  And I think my Brussels carpet
  Somewhat damaged by his spurs.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Fire and furies! what the blazes?"
  Thus in frenzied wrath I call;
  When my spouse her arms upraises,
  With a most astounding squall.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Was there ever such a monster,
  Ever such a wretched wife?
  Ah! how <span class="pagenum"><a name="link114" id="link114"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p114.jpg">114</a></span>long must I endure it,
  How protract this hateful life?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  All day long, quite unprotected,
  Does he leave his wife at home;
  And she cannot see her cousins,
  Even when they kindly come!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then the young Life-Guardsman, rising,
  Scarce vouchsafes a single word,
  But, with look of deadly menace,
  Claps his hand upon his sword;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And in fear I faintly falter&mdash;
  "This your cousin, then he's mine!
  Very glad, indeed, to see you,-
  Won't you stop with us, and dine?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Won't a ferret suck a rabbit?&mdash;
  As a thing of course he stops;
  And with most voracious swallow
  Walks into my mutton-chops.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In the twinkling of a bed-post
  Is each savoury platter clear,
  And he shows uncommon science
  In his estimate of beer.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Half-and-half goes down before him,
  Gurgling from the pewter pot;
  And he <span class="pagenum"><a name="link115" id="link115"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p115.jpg">115</a></span>moves a counter motion
  For a glass of something hot.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Neither chops nor beer I grudge him,
  Nor a moderate share of goes;
  But I know not why he's always
  Treading upon Mary's toes.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Evermore, when, home returning,
  From the counting-house I come,
  Do I find the young Life-Guardsman
  Smoking pipes and drinking rum.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Evermore he stays to dinner,
  Evermore devours my meal;
  For I have a wholesome horror
  Both of powder and of steel.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Yet I know he's Mary's cousin,
  For my only son and heir
  Much resembles that young Guardsman,
  "With the self-same curly hair;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But I wish he would not always
  Spoil my carpet with his spurs;
  And I'd rather see his fingers
  In the fire, than touching hers.

  A league, but barely twa,
  When the lift grew dark, and the waves grew wan,

      href="../44798-page-images/p132.jpg">132</a></span>speed the gallant bark!&mdash;
  I say, you mind my luggage, porter!
  I do not heed yon storm-cloud dark,
  I go to wed old Jenkin's daughter.
  I go to claim my own Mariar,
  The fairest flower that blooms in Harwich;
  My panting bosom is on fire,
  And all is ready for the marriage."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="link133" id="link133"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p133.jpg">133</a></span>spoke young Mivins, as he stepped
  On hoard the "Firefly," Harwich packet;
  The bell rang out, the paddles swept
  Plish-plashing round with noisy racket.
  The louring clouds young Mivins saw,
  But fear, he felt, was only folly;
  And so he smoked a fresh cigar,
  Then fell to whistling "Nix my dolly!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The wind it roared; the packet's hulk
  Rocked with a most unpleasant motion;
  Young Mivins leant him o'er a bulk,
  And poured his sorrows to the ocean.
  Tints&mdash;blue and yellow&mdash;signs of woe&mdash;
  Flushed, rainbow like, his noble face in,
  As suddenly he rushed below,
  Crying, "Steward, steward, bring a basin!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  On sped the bark: the howling storm
  The funnel's tapering smoke did blow far;
  Unmoved, young Mivins' lifeless form
  Was stretched upon a haircloth sofar.
  All night he moaned, the steamer groaned,
  And he was hourly getting fainter;
  When it came bump against the pier,
  And there was fastened by the painter.
  Young Mivins <span class="pagenum"><a name="link134" id="link134"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p134.jpg">134</a></span>rose, arranged his clothes,
  Caught wildly at his small portmanteau;
  He was unfit to lie or sit,
  And found it difficult to stand, too.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He sought the deck, he sought the shore,
  He sought the lady's house like winking,
  And asked, low tapping at the door,
  "Is this the house of Mr Jenkin?"
  A short man came&mdash;he told his name&mdash;
  Mivins was short&mdash;he cut him shorter,
  For in a fury he exclaimed,
  "Are you the man as vants my darter?
  Yot kim'd on you, last night, young sqvire?"
  "It was the steamer, rot and scuttle her!"
  "Mayhap it vos, but our Mariar
  Yalked off last night with Bill the butler."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "And so you've kim'd a post too late."
  "It was the packet, sir, miscarried!"
  "Vy, does you think a gal can vait
  As sets 'er 'art on being married?
  Last night she vowed she'd be a bride,
  And 'ave a spouse for vuss or better:
  So Bill struck in; the knot vos tied,
  And now I vishes you may get her!"

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Young <span class="pagenum"><a name="link135" id="link135"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p135.jpg">135</a></span>Mivins turned him from the spot,
  Bewildered with the dreadful stroke, her
  Perfidy came like a shot&mdash;
  He was a thunder-struck stockbroker.
  "A curse on steam and steamers too!
  By their delays I have been undone!"
  He cried, as, looking very blue,
  He rode a bachelor to London.

      Poems were among those forwarded to the Home Secretary, by "the
      unsuccessful competitors for the Laureateship, on its becoming vacant by
      the death of Southey. How they came into our possession is a matter
      between Sir James Graham and ourselves. The result of the contest could
      never have been doubtful, least of all to the great poet who then
      succeeded to the bays. His own sonnet on the subject is full of the serene
      consciousness of superiority, which does not even admit the idea of
      rivalry, far less of defeat.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bays! which in former days have graced the brow
     Of some, who lived and loved, and sang and died;
     Leaves that were gathered on the pleasant side
     Of old Parnassus from Apollo's bough;
     With palpitating hand I take ye now,
     Since worthier minstrel there is none beside,
     And with a thrill of song half deified,
     I bind them proudly on my locks of snow.
     There shall they bide, till he who follows next,
     Of whom I cannot even guess the name,
     Shall by Court favour, or some vain pretext
     Of fancied merit, desecrate the same,&mdash;
     And think, perchance, he wears them quite as well

  'He's dead, he's dead, the Laureate's dead!' 'Twas thus

  Loud yelled they for Sir James the Graham: but sore

         day?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Loud laughed the Knight of Netherby, and scornfully he
         cried,
  "Or art thou mad with wine, Lord Earl, or art thyself
         beside?
  Eight hundred Bedlam bards have claimed the Laureate's
         vacant crown,
  And now like frantic Bacchanals run wild through London
         town!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Now glory to our gracious Queen!" a voice was heard
         to cry,
  And dark Macaulay stood before them all with frenzied
         eye;
  "Now glory to our gracious Queen, and all her glorious
         race,
  A boon, a boon, my sovran liege! Give me the Laureate's
         place!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "'Twas I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link148" id="link148"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p148.jpg">148</a></span>that sang the might of Rome, the glories of
         Navarre;
  And who could swell the fame so well of Britain's Isles
         afar?
  The hero of a hundred fights&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" Then Wellington up
         sprung,
  "Ho, silence in the ranks, I say! Sit down and hold
        your tongue!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "By heaven, thou shalt not twist my name into a jingling
          lay,
  Or mimic in thy puny song the thunders of Assaye!
  'Tis hard that for thy lust of place in peace we cannot
         dine.
  Nurse, take her Royal Highness, here! Sir Robert, pass
         the wine!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "No Laureate need we at our board!" then spoke the
        Lord of Vaux;
  "Here's many a voice to charm the ear with minstrel
         song, I know.
  Even I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link149" id="link149"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p149.jpg">149</a></span>myself&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" Then rose the cry&mdash;"A song, a
         song from Brougham!"
  He sang,&mdash;and straightway found himself alone within
        the room.

      Wove round me the spells of his Paphian bower;
  When I dipped my light wings in the nectar of joy,
     And soared in the sunshine, the moth of the hour!
  From beauty to beauty I passed, like the wind;
     Now fondled the lily, now toyed with the rose;
  And the fair, that at morn had enchanted my mind,
     Was forsook for another ere evening's close.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I sighed not for honour, I cared not for fame,

  And the harp of my country&mdash;neglected it slept&mdash;
     In hall or by greenwood unheard were its songs;
  From Love's Sybarite dreams I aroused me, and swept
     Its chords to the tale of her glories and wrongs,

  Cannot turn to a fire that glows inwardly now.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  No, its ashes are dead&mdash;and, alas! Love or Song

      THE LAUREATE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    By A- T-.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Who <span class="pagenum"><a name="link152" id="link152"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p152.jpg">152</a></span>would not be
  The Laureate bold,
           With his butt of sherry
           To keep him merry,
  And nothing to do but to pocket his gold?
  'Tis I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link153" id="link153"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p153.jpg">153</a></span>would be the Laureate bold!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When the days are hot, and the sun is strong,
  I'd lounge in the gateway all the day long,
  With her Majesty's footmen in crimson and gold.
  I'd care not a pin for the waiting-lord;
  But I'd lie on my back on the smooth greensward
  With a straw in my mouth, and an open vest,
  And the cool wind blowing upon my breast,
  And I'd vacantly stare at the clear blue sky,
  And watch the clouds as listless as I,
             Lazily, lazily!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And I'd pick the moss and daisies white,
  And chew their stalks with a nibbling bite;
  And I'd let my fancies roam abroad
  In search of a hint for a birthday ode,
             Crazily, crazily!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, that would be the life for me,
  With plenty to get and nothing to do,
  But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue,
  And whistle all day to the Queen's cockatoo,
           Trance-somely, trance-somely!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then the chambermaids, that clean the rooms,
  Would come to the windows and rest on their brooms,
  With their saucy caps and their crisped hair,
  And they'd toss their heads in the fragrant air,
  And say <span class="pagenum"><a name="link154" id="link154"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p154.jpg">154</a></span>to each other&mdash;"Just look down there,
  At the nice young man, so tidy and small,
  Who is paid for writing on nothing at all,
          Handsomely, handsomely!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They would pelt me with matches and sweet pastilles,
  And crumpled-up halls of the royal hills,
  Giggling and laughing, and screaming with fun,
  As they'd see me start, with a leap and a run,
  From the broad of my back to the points of my toes,
  When a pellet of paper hit my nose,
          Teasingly, sneezingly.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then I'd fling them bunches of garden flowers,
  And hyacinths plucked from the Castle bowers;
  And I'd challenge them all to come down to me,
  And I'd kiss them all till they kissèd me,
         Laughingly, laughingly.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, would not that be a merry life,
  Apart from care and apart from strife,
  With the Laureate's wine, and the Laureate's pay,
  And no deductions at quarter-day?
  Oh, that would be the post for me!
  With <span class="pagenum"><a name="link155" id="link155"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p155.jpg">155</a></span>plenty to get and nothing to do,
  But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue,
  And whistle a tune to the Queen's cockatoo,
  And scribble of verses remarkably few,
  And at evening empty a bottle or two,
          Quaffingly, quaffingly!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               'Tis I would be

      A MIDNIGHT MEDITAION
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 By Sir E- B- L-.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Fill me <span class="pagenum"><a name="link156" id="link156"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p156.jpg">156</a></span>once more the foaming pewter up!
      Another hoard of oysters, ladye mine!
  To-night Lucullus with himself shall sup.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  These Mute inglorious Miltons are divine!
      And as I here in slippered ease recline,
  Quaffing of Perkins's Entire my fill,
      I sigh not for the lymph of Aganippe's rill.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A nobler inspiration fires my brain,
      Caught from Old England's fine time-hallowed drink;
  I snatch the pot again and yet again,
      And as the foaming fluids shrink and shrink,
      Fill me once more, I say, up to the brink!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  This makes strong hearts&mdash;strong heads attest its charm&mdash;
  This nerves the might that sleeps in Britain's brawny arm!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But these remarks are neither here nor there.
      Where was I? Oh, I see&mdash;old Southey's dead!
  They'll want some bard to fill the vacant chair,
      And drain the annual butt&mdash;and oh, what head
      More fit with laurel to be garlanded
  Than <span class="pagenum"><a name="link157" id="link157"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p157.jpg">157</a></span>this, which, curled in many a fragrant coil,
  Breathes of Castalia's streams, and best Macassar oil?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I know a grace is seated on my brow,
  Like young Apollo's with his golden beams&mdash;
  There should Apollo's bays be budding now:&mdash;
  And in my flashing eyes the radiance beams
  That marks the poet in his waking dreams,
  When, as his fancies cluster thick and thicker,
  He feels the trance divine of poesy and liquor.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They throng around me now, those things of air,
  That from my fancy took their being's stamp:
  There Pelham sits and twirls his glossy hair,
  There Clifford leads his pals upon the tramp;
  There pale Zanoni, bending o'er his lamp,
  Roams through the starry wilderness of thought,
  Where all is everything, and everything is nought.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Yes, I am he who sang how Aram won
  The gentle ear of pensive Madeline!
  How love and murder hand in hand may run,
  Cemented by philosophy serene,
  And kisses bless the spot where gore has been!
  Who <span class="pagenum"><a name="link158" id="link158"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p158.jpg">158</a></span>breathed the melting sentiment of crime,
  And for the assassin waked a sympathy sublime!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Yes, I am he, who on the novel shed
      Obscure philosophy's enchanting light!
  Until the public, 'wildered as they read,
      Believed they saw that which was not in sight&mdash;
      Of course 'twas not for me to set them right;
  For in my nether heart convinced I am,
  Philosophy's as good as any other bam.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Novels three-volumed I shall write no more&mdash;
      Somehow or other now they will not sell;
  And to invent new passions is a bore&mdash;
      I find the Magazines pay quite as well.
      Translating's simple, too, as I can tell,
  Who've hawked at Schiller on his lyric throne,
  And given the astonished bard a meaning all my own.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Moore, Campbell, Wordsworth, their best days are grassed:
      Battered and broken are their early lyres,
  Rogers, a pleasant memory of the past,
      Warmed his young hands at Smithfield's martyr fires,
      And, worth a plum, nor bays nor butt desires.
  But these are tilings would suit me to the letter,
  For though the Stout is good, old Sherry's greatly better.
  A fico <span class="pagenum"><a name="link159" id="link159"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p159.jpg">159</a></span>for your small poetic ravers,
      Your Hunts, your Tennysons, your Milnes, and these!
  Shall they compete with him who wrote 'Maltravers,'
  Prologue to 'Alice or the Mysteries'?
  No! Even now my glance prophetic sees
  My own high brow girt with the bays about.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Tis merry, 'tis merry in gay greenwood,
      When the little birds are singing,
  When the buck is belling in the fern,
      And the hare from the thicket springing!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Tis merry to hear the waters clear,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But small pleasaunce took Little John
     In all he heard and saw;
  Till he reached the cave of a hermit old
      Who wonned within the shaw.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "<i>Ora pro nobis!</i>" quoth <span class="pagenum"><a name="link172"

  "Now, holy father, hast thou seen
      A frere within the wood?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "By his scarlet hose, and his ruddy nose,
      I guess you may know him well;

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I have served Saint Pancras," the hermit said,
      "In this cell for thirty year,
  Yet never saw I, in the forest bounds,
      The face of such a frere!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "An' if ye find him, master mine,
      E'en take an old man's advice,
  An' raddle him well, till he roar again,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Trust me for that!" quoth Little John&mdash;
      "Trust me for that!" quoth he, with a laugh;
  "There never was man of woman born,
      That asked twice for the taste of my quarter-
           staff!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then <span class="pagenum"><a name="link173" id="link173"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p173.jpg">173</a></span>Little John, he strutted on,
      Till he came to an open bound,
  And he was aware of a Red Friar,
      Was sitting upon the ground.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  His shoulders they were broad and strong,
      And large was he of limb;
  Few yeomen in the north countrie
      Would care to mell with him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He heard the rustling of the boughs,
      As Little John drew near;
  But never a single word he spoke,
      Of welcome or of cheer:
  Less stir he made than a pedlar would
      For a small gnat in his ear!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I like not his looks! thought Little John,
      Nor his staff of the oaken tree.
  Now may our Lady be my help,
      Else beaten I well may be!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "What dost thou here, thou strong Friar,
      In Sherwood's merry round,
  Without the leave of Little John,
      To range with hawk and hound?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Small <span class="pagenum"><a name="link174" id="link174"></a><a

      "Of any leave, I trow;
  That Little John is an outlawed thief,
      And so, I ween, art thou!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Know, I am Prior of Copmanshurst,
      And Bishop of London town,
  And I bring a rope from our father the Pope,
      To put the outlaws down."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then out spoke Little John in wrath,
      "I tell thee, burly frere,
  The Pope may do as he likes at home,
      But he sends no Bishops here!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Up, and away, Red Friar!" he said,
      "Up, and away, right speedilie;
  An it were not for that cowl of thine,
      Avenged on thy body I would be!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Nay, heed not that," said the Red Friar,
      "And let my cowl no hindrance be;
  I warrant that I can give as good
      As ever I think to take from thee!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Little <span class="pagenum"><a name="link175" id="link175"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p175.jpg">175</a></span>John he raised his quarter-staff,
      And so did the burly priest,
  And they fought beneath the greenwood tree
      A stricken hour at least.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But Little John was weak of fence,
      And his strength began to fail;
  Whilst the Friar's blows came thundering down,
      Like the strokes of a threshing-flail.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Now hold thy hand, thou stalwart Friar,
      Now rest beneath the thorn,
  Until I gather breath enow,
      For a blast at my bugle-horn!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I'll hold my hand," the Friar said,
      "Since that is your propine,
  But, an you sound your bugle-horn,
      I'll even blow on mine!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Little John he wound a blast so shrill
      'That it rang o'er rock and linn,
  And Charlie Wood, and his merry men all,
       Came lightly bounding in.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The Friar <span class="pagenum"><a name="link176" id="link176"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p176.jpg">176</a></span>he wound a blast so strong
      That it shook both bush and tree,
  And to his side came witless Will,
      And Jem of Netherbee;
  With all the worst of Robin's band,
      And many a Rapparee!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Little John he wist not what to do,
      When he saw the others come;
  So he twisted his quarter-staff between
      His fingers and his thumb.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "There's some mistake, good Friar!" he said,
      "There's some mistake 'twixt thee and me
  I know thou art Prior of Copmanshurst,
      But not beneath the greenwood tree.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "And if you will take some other name,
      You shall have ample leave to bide;
  With pasture also for your Bulls,
      And power to range the forest wide."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "There's no mistake!" the Friar said;
      "I'll call myself just what I please.
  My doctrine is that chalk is chalk,
      And cheese is nothing else than cheese."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "So be it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link177" id="link177"></a><a

      THE RHYME OF SIR LAUNCELOT BOGLE.

      A LEGEND OF GLASGOW.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  There's <span class="pagenum"><a name="link179" id="link179"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p179.jpg">179</a></span>a pleasant place of rest, near a City of the West,
      Where its bravest and its best find their grave.
  Below <span class="pagenum"><a name="link180" id="link180"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p180.jpg">180</a></span>the willows weep, and their hoary branches steep
      In the waters still and deep,
                              Not a wave!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And the old Cathedral Wall, so scathed and grey and tall.
      Like a priest surveying all, stands beyond;
  And the ringing of its bell, when the ringers ring it well,
      Makes a kind of tidal swell
                              On the pond!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And there it was I lay, on a beauteous summer's day,
     With the odour of the hay floating by;
  And I heard the blackbirds sing, and the bells demurely ring,
     Chime by chime, ting by ting,
                             Droppingly.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then my thoughts went wandering back, on a very beaten
           track,
     To the confine deep and black of the tomb;
  And I wondered who he was, that is laid beneath the
          grass,
     Where the dandelion has
                              Such a bloom.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link181" id="link181"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p181.jpg">181</a></span>straightway did espy, with my slantly-sloping eye,
      A carvèd stone hard by, somewhat worn;
  And I read in letters cold
</pre>
    <p>
      ==> See Page Scan
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Here the letters failed outright, but I knew
  That a stout crusading lord, who had crossed the Jordan's
  ford,
     Lay there beneath the sward,
                            Wet with dew.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Time and tide they passed away, on that pleasant summer's
           day,
     And around me, as I lay, all grew old:
  Sank the chimneys from the town, and the clouds of vapour
  brown
  No longer, like a crown,
                                   O'er it rolled.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sank the great Saint Rollox stalk, like a pile of dingy chalk;
     Disappeared the cypress walk, and the flowers;
  And a donjon-keep arose, that might baffle any foes,
     With its men-at-arms in rows,
                              On the towers.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link182" id="link182"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p182.jpg">182</a></span>flag that flaunted there showed the grim and
            grizzly bear,
  Which the Bogles always wear for their crest.
  And I heard the warder call, as he stood upon the wall,
      "Wake ye up! my comrades all,
                               From your rest!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "For, by the blessed rood, there's a glimpse of armour
           good
  In the deep Cowcaddens wood, o'er the stream;
  And I hear the stifled hum of a multitude that come,
      Though they have not beat the drum,
                               It would seem!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Go tell it to my Lord, lest he wish to man the ford
      With partisan and sword, just beneath;
  Ho, Gilkison and Nares! Ho, Provan of Cowlairs!
     We'll back the bonny bears
                              To the death!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To the tower above the moat, like one who heedeth not,
  Came the bold Sir Launcelot, half undressed;
  On the outer rim he stood, and peered into the wood,
      With his arms across him glued
                                On his breast.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link183" id="link183"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p183.jpg">183</a></span>he muttered, "Foe accurst! hast thou dared to seek
            me first?
  George of Gorbals, do thy worst&mdash;for I swear,
  O'er thy gory corpse to ride, ere thy sister and my bride,
     From my undissevered side
                                Thou shalt tear!

  "Ho, herald mine, Brownlee! ride forth, I pray, and see,
  Who, what, and whence is he, foe or friend!
  Sir Roderick Dalgleish, and my foster-brother Neish,
      With his bloodhounds in the leash,
                                Shall attend."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Forth went the herald stout, o'er the drawbridge and
          without,
      Then a wild and savage shout rose amain,
  Six arrows sped their force, and, a pale and bleeding corse,
      He sank from off his horse
                                On the plain!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Back drew the bold Dalgleish, back started stalwart Neish,
      With his bloodhounds in the leash, from Brownlee.
  "Now shame be to the sword that made thee knight and
           lord,
      Thou caitiff thrice abhorred,
                              Shame on thee!

     Forthwith no end of those heavy bolts.
  Three angels to the brave who finds the foe a grave,
     And a gallows for the slave
                              Who revolts!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ten days the combat lasted; but the bold defenders
          fasted,
      While the foemen, better pastied, fed their host;
  You might hear the savage cheers of the hungry Gorbaliers,
      As at night they dressed the steers
                                 For the roast.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And Sir Launcelot grew thin, and Provan's double chin
     Showed sundry folds of skin down beneath;
  In silence and in grief found Gilkison relief,
     Nor did Neish the spell-word, beef,
                                Dare to breathe.

  To the ramparts Edith came, that fair and youthful dame,

      Besides the beer and mum, extra stout;
  Go straightway to your tasks, and roll me all the casks,
     As also range the flasks,
                               Just without.

  "If I know the Gorbaliers, they are sure to dip their ears
      In the very inmost tiers of the drink.
  Let them win the outer court, and hold it for their sport,
     Since their time is rather short,
                                 I should think!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With a loud triumphant yell, as the heavy drawbridge fell,
     Rushed the Gorbaliers pell-mell, wild as Druids;
  Mad with thirst for human gore, how they threatened and
           they swore,
     Till they stumbled on the floor,
                                  O'er the fluids.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Down their weapons then they threw, and each savage
           soldier drew
  From his belt an iron screw, in his fist;
  George of Gorbals found it vain their excitement to re-
           strain,
     And indeed was rather fain
                                  To assist.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With a beaker in his hand, in the midst he took his stand,
     And silence did command, all below&mdash;
  "Ho! Launcelot the bold, ere thy lips are icy cold,
     In the centre of thy hold,
                             Pledge me now!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Art surly, brother mine? In this cup of rosy wine,
      I drink to the decline of thy race!
  Thy proud career is done, thy sand is nearly run,
     Never more shall setting sun
                                 Gild thy face!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "The pilgrim, in amaze, shall see a goodly blaze,
     Ere the pallid morning rays flicker up;
  And perchance he may espy certain corpses swinging
          high!
     What, brother! art thou dry?
                                      Fill my cup!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dumb as death stood Launcelot, as though he heard him
           not,
     But his bosom Provan smote, and he swore:
  And Sir Roderick Dalgleish remarked aside to Neish,
     "Never sure did thirsty fish
                          Swallow more!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Thirty <span class="pagenum"><a name="link188" id="link188"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p188.jpg">188</a></span>casks are nearly done, yet the revel's scarce
            begun;
     It were knightly sport and fun to strike in!"
  "Nay, tarry till they come," quoth Neish, "unto the
          rum&mdash;
     They are working at the mum,
                               And the gin!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then straight there did appear to each gallant Gorbalier
     Twenty castles dancing near, all around;
  The solid earth did shake, and the stones beneath them
           quake,
     And sinuous as a snake
                             Moved the ground.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Why and wherefore they had come, seemed intricate to
           some,
     But all agreed the rum was divine.
  And they looked with bitter scorn on their leader highly
           born,
     Who preferred to fill his horn
                              Up with wine!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then said Launcelot the tall, "Bring the chargers from
           their stall;
     Lead them straight unto the hall, down below:
  Draw <span class="pagenum"><a name="link189" id="link189"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p189.jpg">189</a></span>your weapons from your side, fling the gates asunder
            wide,
     And together we shall ride
                                On the foe!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Then Provan knew full well, as he leaped into his selle,
     That few would 'scape to tell how they fared;
  And Gilkison and Nares, both mounted on their mares,
     Looked terrible as bears,
                               All prepared.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With his bloodhounds in the leash, stood the iron-sinewed
           Neish,
      And the falchion of Dalgleish glittered bright&mdash;
  "Now, wake the trumpet's blast; and, comrades, follow
           fast;
     Smite them down unto the last!"
                               Cried the knight.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In the cumbered yard without, there was shriek, and yell,
           and shout,
     As the warriors wheeled about, all in mail.
  On the miserable kerne fell the death-strokes stiff and stern,
      As the deer treads down the fern,
                                 In the vale!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Saint <span class="pagenum"><a name="link190" id="link190"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p190.jpg">190</a></span>Mungo be my guide! It was goodly in that tide
     To see the Bogle ride in his haste;
  He accompanied each blow with a cry of "Ha!" or
          "Ho!"
     And always cleft the foe
                                To the waist.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "George of Gorbals&mdash;craven lord! thou didst threat me
           with the cord;
     Come forth and brave my sword, if you dare!"
  But he met with no reply, and never could descry
     The glitter of his eye
                           Anywhere.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ere the dawn of morning shone, all the Gorbaliers were
           down,
     Like a field of barley mown in the ear:
  It had done a soldier good to see how Provan stood,
     With Neish all bathed in blood,
                               Panting near.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Now ply ye to your tasks&mdash;go carry down those casks,
     And place the empty flasks on the floor;
  George of Gorbals scarce will come, with trumpet and
           with drum,
     To taste our beer and rum
                               Any more!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  So <span class="pagenum"><a name="link191" id="link191"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p191.jpg">191</a></span>they plied them to their tasks, and they carried down
            the casks,
      And replaced the empty flasks on the floor;
  But pallid for a week was the cellar-master's cheek,.
     For he swore he heard a shriek
                              Through the door.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When the merry Christmas came, and the Yule-log lent
           its flame
      To the face of squire and dame in the hall,
  The cellarer went down to tap October brown,
     Which was rather of renown
                               'Mongst them all.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He placed the spigot low, and gave the cask a blow,
      But his liquor would not flow through the pin.
  "Sure, 'tis sweet as honeysuckles!" so he rapped it with
            his knuckles,
      But a sound, as if of buckles,
                               Clashed within.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Bring a hatchet, varlets, here!" and they cleft the cask
            of beer:
      What a spectacle of fear met their sight!
  There George of Gorbals lay, skull and bones all blanched
            and grey,
     In the arms he bore the day
                                   Of the fight!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I have <span class="pagenum"><a name="link192" id="link192"></a><a

      Though the moral ye may fail to perceive;
  Sir Launcelot is dust, and his gallant sword is rust,
     And now, I think, I must

  Didst thou not praise me, Gaultier, at the hall,
  Ripe lips, trim boddice, and a waist so small,

      Beneath the robe of pea-y greeniness?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dost thou remember, when, with stately prance,
  Our heads went crosswise in the country-dance;
  How <span class="pagenum"><a name="link198" id="link198"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p198.jpg">198</a></span>soft, warm fingers, tipped like "buds of balm,

  And how a cheek grew flushed and peachy-wise
  At the frank lifting of thy cordial eyes?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ah, me! that night there was one gentle thing,
  Who, like a dove, with its scarce feathered wing,
  Fluttered at the approach of thy quaint swaggering!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  There's wont to be, at conscious times like these,
  An affectation of a bright-eyed ease,&mdash;
  A crispy cheekiness, if so I dare
  Describe the swaling of a jaunty air;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And thus, when swirling from the waltz's wheel,
  You craved my hand to grace the next quadrille,
  That smiling voice, although it made me start,
  Boiled in the meek o'erlifting of my heart;.
  And, picking at my flowers, I said, with free
  And usual tone, "O yes, sir, certainly!"

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Like one that swoons, 'twixt sweet amaze and fear,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  So, when a tall Knight Templar ringing came,
  And took his place amongst us with his dame,
  I neither turned away, nor bashful shrunk

  But, threading through the figure, first in rule,
  I paused to see thee plunge into La Poule.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ah, what a sight was that! Not prurient Mars,
  Pointing his toe through ten celestial bars&mdash;
  Not young Apollo, beamily arrayed
  In tripsome guise for Juno's masquerade&mdash;
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Not smartest Hermes, with his pinion girth,
  Jerking with freaks and snatches down to earth,
  Looked half so bold, so beautiful, and strong,
  As thou, when pranking through the glittering throng!
  How the calmed ladies looked with eyes of love
  On thy trim velvet doublet laced above;
  The hem of gold, that, like a wavy river,
  Flowed down into thy back with glancing shiver!
  So bare was thy fine throat, and curls of black,
  So lightsomely dropped in thy lordly back,
  So crisply swaled the feather in thy bonnet,
  So glanced thy thigh, and spanning palm upon it,
  That my weak soul took instant flight to thee,
  Lost in the fondest gush of that sweet witchery!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But when the dance was o'er, and arm in arm
  (The full heart beating 'gainst the elbow warm)
  We passed into the great refreshment-hall,
  Where the heaped cheese-cakes and the comfits small
  Lay, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link200" id="link200"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p200.jpg">200</a></span>like a hive of sunbeams, brought to burn
  Around the margin of the negus urn;
  When my poor quivering hand you fingered twice,
  And, with inquiring accents, whispered "Ice,
  Water, or cream?" I could no more dissemble,
  But dropped upon the couch all in a tremble.
  A swimming faintness misted o'er my brain,
  The corks seemed starting from the brisk champagne,
  The custards fell untouched upon the floor,
  Thine eyes met mine. That night we danced no more!

  And an arm embraced young Leila's waist&mdash;
     "Beloved! I am here!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Like the phantom form that rules the storm,
     Appeared the pirate lover,
  And his fiery eye was like Zatanai,
     As he fondly bent above her.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Speak, Leila, speak; for my light caïque
     Rides proudly in yonder bay;
  I have come from my rest to her I love best,
     To carry thee, love, away.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The breast of thy lover shall shield thee, and cover
     My own jemscheed from harm;
  Think'st thou I fear the dark vizier,
     Or the mufti's vengeful arm?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Then droop not, love, nor turn away
     From this rude hand of mine!
  And Leila looked in her lover's eyes,
     And murmured&mdash;"I am thine!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But a gloomy man with a yataghan
     Stole through the acacia-blossoms,
  And the thrust he made with his gleaming blade
     Hath pierced through both their bosoms.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "There! there! thou cursed caitiff Giaour!
     There, there, thou false one, lie!"
  Remorseless Hassan stands above,
     And he smiles to see them die.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  They sleep beneath the fresh green turf.
     The lover and the lady&mdash;
  And the maidens wail to hear the tale
     Of the daughter of the Cadi!

      THE DEATH OF DUBAL

      ["Methinks <span class="pagenum"><a name="link208" id="link208"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p208.jpg">208</a></span>I see him already in

      crowd extolling his resolution and intrepidity! What volleys of sighs are
      sent from the windows of Holbom, that so comely a youth should be brought
      to disgrace! I see him at the tree! the whole circle are in tears! even
      butchers weep!"&mdash; Beggars' Opera.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A living sea of eager human faces,
  A thousand bosoms throbbing all as one,
  Walls, windows, balconies, all sorts of places,
  Holding their crowds of gazers to the sun:
     Through the hushed groups low-buzzing murmurs run;
  And on the air, with slow reluctant swell,
  Comes the dull funeral-boom of old Sepulchre's bell.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, joy in London now! in festal measure
  Be spent the evening of this festive day!
  For thee is opening now a high-strung pleasure;
     Now, even now, in yonder press-yard they
     Strike from his limbs the fetters loose away!
  A little while, and he, the brave Duval,
  Will issue forth, serene, to glad and greet you all.
  "Why comes he not? say, wherefore doth he tarry?"
  Starts the inquiry loud from every tongue.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Surely," they cry, "that tedious Ordinary
     His tedious psalms must long ere this have sung,&mdash;
     Tedious to him that's waiting to be hung!"
  But hark! old Newgate's doors fly wide apart.
  "He comes, he comes!" A thrill shoots through each
        gazer's heart.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Joined in the stunning cry ten thousand voices,
  All Smithfield answered to the loud acclaim.
  "He comes, he comes!" and every breast rejoices,
     As down Snow Hill the shout tumultuous came,
     Bearing to Holborn's crowd the welcome fame.
  "He comes, he comes!" and each holds back his breath&mdash;
  Some ribs are broke, and some few scores are crushed to
         death.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With step majestic to the cart advances
     The dauntless Claude, and springs into his seat.
  He feels that on him now are fixed the glances
  Of many a Briton bold and maiden sweet,
  Whose hearts responsive to his glories beat.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In him the honour of "The Road" is centred,
  And all the hero's fire into his bosom entered.
  His <span class="pagenum"><a name="link210" id="link210"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p210.jpg">210</a></span>was the transport&mdash;his the exultation
      Of Rome's great generals, when from afar,
  Up to the Capitol in the ovation,
     They bore with them, in the triumphal car,
     Rich gold and gems, the spoils of foreign war.
  <i>Io Triumphe!</i> They forgot their clay.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  E'en so Duval, who rode in glory on his way,
  His laced cravat, his kids of purest yellow,
     The many-tinted nosegay in his hand,
  His large black eyes, so fiery, yet so mellow,
     Like the old vintages of Spanish land,
     Locks clustering o'er a brow of high command,
  Subdue all hearts; and, as up Holborn's steep
  Toils the slow car of death, e'en cruel butchers weep.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He saw it, but he heeded not. His story,
     He knew, was graven on the page of Time.
  Tyburn to him was as a field of glory,
     Where he must stoop to death his head sublime,
     Hymned in full many an elegiac rhyme.
  He left his deeds behind him, and his name&mdash;
  For he, like Cæsar, had lived long enough for fame.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He quailed not, save when, as he raised the chalice,&mdash;
      St Giles's bowl,&mdash;filled with the mildest ale,
  To pledge <span class="pagenum"><a name="link211" id="link211"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p211.jpg">211</a></span>the crowd, on her&mdash;his beauteous Alice&mdash;
  His eye alighted, and his cheek grew pale.
      She, whose sweet breath was like the spicy gale,
  She, whom he fondly deemed his own dear girl,
  Stood with a tall dragoon, drinking long draughts of
         purl.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He bit his lip&mdash;it quivered but a moment&mdash;
      Then passed his hand across his flushing brows:
  He could have spared so forcible a comment
  Upon the constancy of woman's vows.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  One short sharp pang his hero-soul allows;
  But in the bowl he drowned the stinging pain,
  And on his pilgrim course went calmly forth again.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A princely group of England's noble daughters
  Stood in a balcony suffused with grief,
  Diffusing fragrance round them, of strong waters,
  And waving many a snowy handkerchief;
    Then glowed the prince of highwayman and thief!
  His soul was touched with a seraphic gleam&mdash;
  That woman could be false was but a mocking dream.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And now, his bright career of triumph ended,
  His chariot stood beneath the triple tree.
  The law's <span class="pagenum"><a name="link212" id="link212"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p212.jpg">212</a></span>grim finisher to its boughs ascended,
     And fixed the hempen bandages, while he
     Bowed to the throng, then bade the car go free.
  The car rolled on, and left him dangling there,
  Like famed Mohammed's tomb, uphung midway in air.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  As droops the cup of the surchargèd lily
  Beneath the buffets of the surly storm,
  Or the soft petals of the daffodilly,
     When Sirius is uncomfortably warm,
     So drooped his head upon his manly form,
  While floated in the breeze his tresses brown.
  He hung the stated time, and then they cut him down.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With soft and tender care the trainbands bore him,
     Just as they found him, nightcap, robe, and all,
  And placed this neat though plain inscription o'er him,
     Among the atomies in Surgeons' Hall:
     "<i>These are the Bones of the Renowned Duval!</i>"
  There still they tell us, from their glassy case,
  He was the last, the best of all that noble race!

  They're sure to come with phrases nice,
  And modest air, for your advice.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But as a truth unfailing make it,
  They ask, but never mean to take it.
  'Tis not advice they want, in fact,
  But confirmation in their act.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now mark what did, in such a case,
  A worthy priest who knew the race.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A dame more buxom, blithe, and free,
  Than Fredegonde you scarce would see.
  So smart her dress, so trim her shape,
  N e'er hostess offered juice of grape,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Could <span class="pagenum"><a name="link217" id="link217"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p217.jpg">217</a></span>for her trade wish better sign;
  Her looks gave flavour to her wine,
  And each guest feels it, as he sips,
  Smack of the ruby of her lips.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A smile for all, a welcome glad,&mdash;
  A jovial coaxing way she had;
  And,&mdash;what was more her fate than blame,&mdash;
  A nine months' widow was our dame.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But toil was hard, for trade was good,
  And gallants sometimes will be rude.
  "And what can a lone woman do?
  The nights are long and eerie too.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now, Guillot there's a likely man,
  None better draws or taps a can;
  He's just the man, I think, to suit,
  If I could bring my courage to't."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  With thoughts like these her mind is crossed:
  The dame, they say, who doubts, is lost.
  "But then the risk? I'll beg a slice
  Of Father Raulin's good advice."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Prankt in her best, with looks demure,
  She seeks the priest; and, to be sure,
  Asks if he thinks she ought to wed:
  "With such a business on my head,
  I'm <span class="pagenum"><a name="link218" id="link218"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p218.jpg">218</a></span>worried off my legs with care,
  And need some help to keep things square.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I've thought of Guillot, truth to tell!
  He's steady, knows his business well.
  What do you think?" When thus he met her:
  "Oh, take him, dear, you can't do better!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "But then the danger, my good pastor,
  If of the man I make the master.
  There is no trusting to these men."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Well, well, my dear, don't have him, then!"
  "But help I must have; there's the curse.
  I may go farther and fare worse."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Why, take him, then!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"But if he should
  Turn out a thankless ne'er-do-good&mdash;
  In drink and riot waste my all,
  And rout me out of house and hall?"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Don't have him, then! But I've a plan
  To clear your doubts, if any can.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The bells a peal are ringing,&mdash;hark!
  Go straight, and what they tell you mark.
  If they say 'Yes!' wed, and be blest&mdash;
  If 'No,' why&mdash;do as you think best."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The bells rang out a triple bob:
  Oh, how our widow's heart did throb,
  As <span class="pagenum"><a name="link219" id="link219"></a><a
      href="../44798-page-images/p219.jpg">219</a></span>thus she heard their burden go,
  "Marry, mar-marry, mar-Guillot!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Bells were not then left to hang idle:
  A week,&mdash;and they rang for her bridal.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But, woe the while, they might as well
  Have rung the poor dame's parting knell.
  The rosy dimples left her cheek,
  She lost her beauties plump and sleek;
  For Guillot oftener kicked than kissed,
  And backed his orders with his fist,
  Proving by deeds as well as words
  That servants make the worst of lords.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  She seeks the priest, her ire to wreak,
  And speaks as angry women speak,
  With tiger looks and bosom swelling,
  Cursing the hour she took his telling.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To all, his calm reply was this,&mdash;
  "I fear you've read the bells amiss:
  If they have led you wrong in aught,
  Your wish, not they, inspired the thought.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Just go, and mark well what they say."
  Off trudged the dame upon her way,
  And sure enough their chime went so,&mdash;
  "Don't have that knave, that knave Guillot!"
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Too true," she cried, "there's not a doubt
  What could my ears have been about?"
  She had forgot, that, as fools think,
  The bell is ever sure to clink.

   Thou speak'st of hours when I was young,
      And happiness arose unsought;
   When she, the whispering woods among,
      Gave me thy bloom&mdash;Forget-me-not!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   That rapturous hour with that dear maid

  Oh, Memory! thou art but a sigh
      For friendships dead and loves forgot,

      That once did say&mdash;Forget me not!

  And I must bow me to thy laws,
      For&mdash;odd although it may be thought&mdash;
  I can't tell who the deuce it was

  There is dust upon thy visage,&mdash;
  Think not, Charles, I would hurt ye,
  When I say, that altogether
  You appear extremely dirty.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Frown not, brother, now, but hie thee
     To thy chamber's distant room;
  Drown the odours of the ledger
     With the lavender's perfume.
  Brush the mud from off thy trousers,
     O'er the china basin kneel,
  Lave thy brows in water softened
     With the soap of Old Castile.

  "Smooth the locks that o'er thy forehead
     'Now in loose disorder stray;
  Pare thy nails, and from thy whiskers
  Cut those ragged points away;

     Thy bewildered brain beset;
  Life has other hopes than Cocker's,
      Other joys than tare and tret.

  "Haste thee, for I ordered dinner,
     Waiting to the very last,
  Twenty minutes after seven,

  One, might wake the soul of Curtis
     From death's drowsy atrophy.

  "There is soup of real turtle,
     Turbot, and the dainty sole;
  And the mottled row of lobsters
     Blushes through the butter-bowl.
  There the lordly haunch of mutton,
     Tender as the mountain grass,
  Waits to mix its ruddy juices
     With the girdling caper-sauce.

  "There a stag, whose branching forehead
     Spoke him monarch of the herds,
  He whose flight was o'er the heather

     And the haunch that wont to dash
  O'er the roaring mountain-torrent,
  Smokes in most delicious hash.

  "There, besides, are amber jellies.
     Floating like a golden dream;
  Ginger from the far Bermudas,
